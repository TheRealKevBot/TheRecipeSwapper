# The Recipe Swapper

If you love eating delicous food or cooking delicious food then this is for you!

Thi ia an app where foodies of all kind can go not only find new recipes to try new delicious foods but also to learn more about the food wrold from our blog post section. 

## General Info
This web based app allows users to sign-up and create an account with us. Our home page allows users to view the most currently liseted reciepes. The feed of reciepes will show you dirrerent cards listing the name of the dish, the creator, the total amount of time needed to cook and prepare, as well their statemen. Should you decide to cook one of these delicious dishes you will be then directed to the full recipe which will list the ingredents as well as the steps needed for completion. 

## Inspiration
My main driving force for creating this project is mainly due to my mother still living in the 21st century having mutliple cookbooks and recipe cards around. I realized there was a better way to organize and share your favorite reciepes with not only your loved ones but with anyone who enjoys delicious food!

## Getting Started
### Backend
You will need to cd into the Recipe_Swapper.1 folder, this is the Ruby on Rails backend folder. To get things started you will first need to ```bundle install```, this will install all the Ruby gems needed. If you encounter an error due to your version of ruby simply go to line 4 of the Gemfile and fix as needed i.e. ruby '2.6.5' to ruby '2.6.6'. You will then need to create your local database by running ```rake db:migrate```. In addition you will need to seed your database by running ```rake db:seed``` in your console. Once everything has completed you can start your rails server by running ```rails s```.
### Frontend
To get your frontend up and running you will simply need to cd in the frontend folder, this is the JavaScript frontend folder. To start up your frontend server you will simply need to run ```lite-server```, if not installed I highly recommend it, will open The Recipe Swapper in your browser.
